#FOPRUN=true
FOPWEBROOT=/var/www/html/panel
#FOPPASSWORD=passw0rd
FOPPASSWORD=jEhdIekWmdjE

# FOPSORT=extension|lastname
# DEFAULT VALUE: extension
# FOP should sort extensions by Last Name [lastname] or by Extension [extension]

# This is the default admin name used to allow an administrator to login to ARI bypassing all security.
# Change this to whatever you want, don't forget to change the ARI_ADMIN_PASSWORD as well
ARI_ADMIN_USERNAME=admin

# This is the default admin password to allow an administrator to login to ARI bypassing all security.
# Change this to a secure password.
ARI_ADMIN_PASSWORD=jEhdIekWmdjE

# AUTHTYPE=database|none
# Authentication type to use for web admininstration. If type set to 'database', the primary
# AMP admin credentials will be the AMPDBUSER/AMPDBPASS above.
AUTHTYPE=database

# AMPADMINLOGO=filename
# Defines the logo that is to be displayed at the TOP RIGHT of the admin screen. This enables
# you to customize the look of the administration screen.
# NOTE: images need to be saved in the ..../admin/images directory of your AMP install
# This image should be 55px in height
AMPADMINLOGO=logo.png

# USECATEGORIES=true|false
# DEFAULT VALUE: true
# Controls if the menu items in the admin interface are sorted by category (true), or sorted 
# alphabetically with no categories shown (false).

# AMPEXTENSIONS=extensions|deviceanduser
# Sets the extension behavior in FreePBX.  If set to 'extensions', Devices and Users are
# administered together as a unified Extension, and appear on a single page.
# If set to 'deviceanduser', Devices and Users will be administered seperately.  Devices (e.g. 
# each individual line on a SIP phone) and Users (e.g. '101') will be configured 
# independent of each other, allowing association of one User to many Devices, or allowing 
# Users to login and logout of Devices.
AMPEXTENSIONS=extensions

# ENABLECW=true|false
ENABLECW=no
# DEFAULT VALUE: true
# Enable call waiting by default when an extension is created. Set to 'no' to if you don't want 
# phones to be commissioned with call waiting already enabled. The user would then be required
# to dial the CW feature code (*70 default) to enable their phone. Most installations should leave
# this alone. It allows multi-line phones to receive multiple calls on their line appearances.

# CWINUSEBUSY=true|false
# DEFAULT VALUE: true
# For extensions that have CW enabled, report unanswered CW calls as 'busy' (resulting in busy 
# voicemail greeting). If set to no, unanswered CW calls simply report as 'no-answer'.

# AMPBADNUMBER=true|false
# DEFAULT VALUE: true
# Generate the bad-number context which traps any bogus number or feature code and plays a
# message to the effect. If you use the Early Dial feature on some Grandstream phones, you
# will want to set this to false.

# AMPBACKUPSUDO=true|false
# DEFAULT VALUE: false
# This option allows you to use sudo when backing up files. Useful ONLY when using AMPPROVROOT
# Allows backup and restore of files specified in AMPPROVROOT, based on permissions in /etc/sudoers
# for example, adding the following to sudoers would allow the user asterisk to run tar on ANY file
# on the system:
#	asterisk localhost=(root)NOPASSWD: /bin/tar
#	Defaults:asterisk !requiretty
# PLEASE KEEP IN MIND THE SECURITY RISKS INVOLVED IN ALLOWING THE ASTERISK USER TO TAR/UNTAR ANY FILE

# CUSTOMASERROR=true|false
# DEFAULT VALUE: true
# If false, then the Destination Registry will not report unknown destinations as errors. This should be
# left to the default true and custom destinations should be moved into the new custom apps registry.

# DYNAMICHINTS=true|false
# DEFAULT VALUE: false
# If true, Core will not statically generate hints, but instead make a call to the AMPBIN php script, 
# and generate_hints.php through an Asterisk's #exec call. This requires Asterisk.conf to be configured 
# with "execincludes=yes" set in the [options] section.

# XTNCONFLICTABORT=true|false
# BADDESTABORT=true|false
# DEFAULT VALUE: false
# Setting either of these to true will result in retrieve_conf aborting during a reload if an extension
# conflict is detected or a destination is detected. It is usually better to allow the reload to go
# through and then correct the problem but these can be set if a more strict behavior is desired.

# SERVERINTITLE=true|false
# DEFAULT VALUE: false
# Precede browser title with the server name.

# USEDEVSTATE = true|false
# DEFAULT VALUE: false
# If this is set, it assumes that you are running Asterisk 1.4 or higher and want to take advantage of the
# func_devstate.c backport available from Asterisk 1.6. This allows custom hints to be created to support
# BLF for server side feature codes such as daynight, followme, etc.

# MODULEADMINWGET=true|false
# DEFAULT VALUE: false
# Module Admin normally tries to get its online information through direct file open type calls to URLs that
# go back to the freepbx.org server. If it fails, typically because of content filters in firewalls that
# don't like the way PHP formats the requests, the code will fall back and try a wget to pull the information.
# This will often solve the problem. However, in such environment there can be a significant timeout before
# the failed file open calls to the URLs return and there are often 2-3 of these that occur. Setting this
# value will force FreePBX to avoid the attempt to open the URL and go straight to the wget calls.

# AMPDISABLELOG=true|false
# DEFAULT VALUE: true
# Whether or not to invoke the FreePBX log facility

# AMPSYSLOGLEVEL=LOG_EMERG|LOG_ALERT|LOG_CRIT|LOG_ERR|LOG_WARNING|LOG_NOTICE|LOG_INFO|LOG_DEBUG|LOG_SQL|SQL
# DEFAULT VALUE: LOG_ERR
# Where to log if enabled, SQL, LOG_SQL logs to old MySQL table, others are passed to syslog system to
# determine where to log

# AMPENABLEDEVELDEBUG=true|false
# DEFAULT VALUE: false
# Whether or not to include log messages marked as 'devel-debug' in the log system

# AMPMPG123=true|false 
# DEFAULT VALUE: true
# When set to false, the old MoH behavior is adopted where MP3 files can be loaded and WAV files converted
# to MP3. The new default behavior assumes you have mpg123 loaded as well as sox and will convert MP3 files
# to WAV. This is highly recommended as MP3 files heavily tax the system and can cause instability on a busy
# phone system.

# CDR DB Settings: Only used if you don't use the default values provided by FreePBX.
# CDRDBHOST: hostname of db server if not the same as AMPDBHOST
# CDRDBPORT: Port number for db host 
# CDRDBUSER: username to connect to db with if it's not the same as AMPDBUSER
# CDRDBPASS: password for connecting to db if it's not the same as AMPDBPASS
# CDRDBNAME: name of database used for cdr records
# CDRDBTYPE: mysql or postgres mysql is default
# CDRDBTABLENAME: Name of the table in the db where the cdr is stored cdr is default 

# AMPVMUMASK=mask 
# DEFAULT VALUE: 077 
# Defaults to 077 allowing only the asterisk user to have any permission on VM files. If set to something
# like 007, it would allow the group to have permissions. This can be used if setting apache to a different
# user then asterisk, so that the apache user (and thus ARI) can have access to read/write/delete the
# voicemail files. If changed, some of the voicemail directory structures may have to be manually changed.

# DASHBOARD_STATS_UPDATE_TIME=integer_seconds
# DEFAULT VALUE: 6
# DASHBOARD_INFO_UPDATE_TIME=integer_seconds
# DEFAULT VALUE: 20
# These can be used to change the refresh rate of the System Status Panel. Most of
# the stats are updated based on the STATS interval but a few items are checked
# less frequently (such as Asterisk Uptime) based on the INFO value

# ZAP2DAHDICOMPAT=true|false
ZAP2DAHDICOMPAT=true
# DEFAULT VALUE: false
# If set to true, FreePBX will check if you have chan_dadhi installed. If so, it will
# automatically use all your ZAP configuration settings (devices and trunks) and
# silently convert them, under the covers, to DAHDI so no changes are needed. The
# GUI will continue to refer to these as ZAP but it will use the proper DAHDI channels.
# This will also keep Zap Channel DIDs working.

# CHECKREFERER=true|false
# DEFAULT VALUE: true
# When set to the default value of true, all requests into FreePBX that might possibly add/edit/delete
# settings will be validated to assure the request is coming from the server. This will protect the system
# from CSRF (cross site request forgery) attacks. It will have the effect of preventing legitimately entering
# URLs that could modify settings which can be allowed by changing this field to false.

# USEQUEUESTATE=true|false
# DEFAULT VALUE: false
# Setting this flag will generate the required dialplan to integrate with the following Asterisk patch:
# https://issues.asterisk.org/view.php?id=15168
# This feature is planned for a future 1.6 release but given the existence of the patch can be used prior. Once
# the release version is known, code will be added to automatically enable this format in versions of Asterisk
# that support it.

# USEGOOGLEDNSFORENUM=true|false
# DEFAULT VALUE: false
# Setting this flag will generate the required global variable so that enumlookup.agi will use Google DNS
# 8.8.8.8 when performing an ENUM lookup. Not all DNS deals with NAPTR record, but Google does. There is a
# drawback to this as Google tracks every lookup. If you are not comfortable with this, do not enable this
# setting. Please read Google FAQ about this: http://code.google.com/speed/public-dns/faq.html#privacy

# MOHDIR=subdirectory_name
# This is the subdirectory for the MoH files/directories which is located in ASTVARLIBDIR
# if not specified it will default to mohmp3 for backward compatibility.
MOHDIR=mohmp3
# RELOADCONFIRM=true|false
# DEFAULT VALUE: true
# When set to false, will bypass the confirm on Reload Box

# FCBEEPONLY=true|false
# DEFAULT VALUE: false
# When set to true, a beep is played instead of confirmation message when activating/de-activating:
# CallForward, CallWaiting, DayNight, DoNotDisturb and FindMeFollow

# DISABLECUSTOMCONTEXTS=true|false
# DEFAULT VALUE: false
# Normally FreePBX auto-generates a custom context that may be usable for adding custom dialplan to modify the
# normal behavior of FreePBX. It takes a good understanding of how Asterisk processes these includes to use
# this and in many of the cases, there is no useful application. All includes will result in a WARNING in the
# Asterisk log if there is no context found to include though it results in no errors. If you know that you
# want the includes, you can set this to true. If you comment it out FreePBX will revert to legacy behavior
# and include the contexts.

# AMPMODULEXML lets you change the module repository that you use. By default, it
# should be set to http://mirror.freepbx.org/ - Presently, there are no third
# party module repositories.
AMPMODULEXML=http://mirror.freepbx.org/

# AMPMODULESVN is the prefix that is appended to <location> tags in the XML file.
# This should be set to http://mirror.freepbx.org/modules/
AMPMODULESVN=http://mirror.freepbx.org/modules/
